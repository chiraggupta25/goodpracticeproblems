# goodpracticeproblems

This repository is created to house solutions to interesting problems that are solved by libraries already across different languages. However, the idea is how you would solve them?

This is an attempt to write code to solve those challenges. The attemt is to look at concept if that is correct or not. If there is someone who has better ideas, please add comments.
